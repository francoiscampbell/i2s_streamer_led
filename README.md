# I<sup>2</sup>S masking streamer
Mini-project to stream in I<sup>2</sup>S data and output a masked value depending on the node address. This will be used in another project where I abuse I2S to send video data and each node needs to know what parts of the stream are relevant to it without using too much RAM.

More details to come.
